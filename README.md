# `Richtext editor`

## `Overview`

This project is a sub-component of a bigger app I developed, which was oriented around text formatting. It contains the most commonly used richtext edition action buttons which are:
- bold / italics / underline
- superscript / subscript
- ordered list / unordered list
- Greek alphabet symbols
- mathematical notation symbols
- undo / redo buttons
- align left / right / center / jusify
